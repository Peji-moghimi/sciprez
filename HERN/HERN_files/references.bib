              biomedicine, energy, and materials science, but creating designs
              that succeed is difficult in practice. A significant aspect of
              this challenge is the complex coupling between protein sequence
              and 3D structure, with the task of finding a viable design often
              referred to as the inverse protein folding problem. We develop
              relational language models for protein sequences that directly
              condition on a graph specification of the target structure. Our
              approach efficiently captures the complex dependencies in
              proteins by focusing on those that are long-range in sequence but
              local in 3D space. Our framework significantly improves in both
              speed and robustness over conventional and deep-learning-based
              methods for structure-based protein sequence design, and takes a
              step toward rapid and targeted biomolecular design with the aid
              of deep generative models.",

  author    = "Vogt, Austin D and Pozzi, Nicola and Chen, Zhiwei and Di Cera,
               Enrico",
  abstract  = "Two competing and mutually exclusive mechanisms of ligand
               recognition - conformational selection and induced fit - have
               dominated our interpretation of ligand binding in biological
               macromolecules for almost six decades. Conformational selection
               posits the pre-existence of multiple conformations of the
               macromolecule from which the ligand selects the optimal one.
               Induced fit, on the other hand, postulates the existence of
               conformational rearrangements of the original conformation into
               an optimal one that are induced by binding of the ligand. In the
               former case, conformational transitions precede the binding
               event; in the latter, conformational changes follow the binding
               step. Kineticists have used a facile criterion to distinguish
               between the two mechanisms based on the dependence of the rate
               of relaxation to equilibrium, kobs, on the ligand concentration,
               [L]. A value of kobs decreasing hyperbolically with [L] has been
               seen as diagnostic of conformational selection, while a value of
               kobs increasing hyperbolically with [L] has been considered
               diagnostic of induced fit. However, this simple conclusion is
               only valid under the rather unrealistic assumption of
               conformational transitions being much slower than binding and
               dissociation events. In general, induced fit only produces
               values of kobs that increase with [L] but conformational
               selection is more versatile and is associated with values of
               kobs that increase with, decrease with or are independent of
               [L]. The richer repertoire of kinetic properties of
               conformational selection applies to kinetic mechanisms with
               single or multiple saturable relaxations and explains the
               behavior of nearly all experimental systems reported in the
               literature thus far. Conformational selection is always
               sufficient and often necessary to account for the relaxation
               kinetics of ligand binding to a biological macromolecule and is
               therefore an essential component of any binding mechanism. On
               the other hand, induced fit is never necessary and only
               sufficient in a few cases. Therefore, the long assumed
               importance and preponderance of induced fit as a mechanism of
               ligand binding should be reconsidered.",

  abstract  = "The function of antibodies (Abs) involves specific binding to
               antigens (Ags) and activation of other components of the immune
               system to fight pathogens. The six hypervariable loops within
               the variable domains of Abs, commonly termed complementarity
               determining regions (CDRs), are widely assumed to be responsible
               for Ag recognition, while the constant domains are believed to
               mediate effector activation. Recent studies and analyses of the
               growing number of available Ab structures, indicate that this
               clear functional separation between the two regions may be an
               oversimplification. Some positions within the CDRs have been
               shown to never participate in Ag binding and some off-CDRs
               residues often contribute critically to the interaction with the
               Ag. Moreover, there is now growing evidence for non-local and
               even allosteric effects in Ab-Ag interaction in which Ag binding
               affects the constant region and vice versa. This review
               summarizes and discusses the structural basis of Ag recognition,
               elaborating on the contribution of different structural
               determinants of the Ab to Ag binding and recognition. We discuss
               the CDRs, the different approaches for their identification and
               their relationship to the Ag interface. We also review what is
               currently known about the contribution of non-CDRs regions to Ag
               recognition, namely the framework regions (FRs) and the constant
               domains. The suggested mechanisms by which these regions
               contribute to Ag binding are discussed. On the Ag side of the
               interaction, we discuss attempts to predict B-cell epitopes and
               the suggested idea to incorporate Ab information into B-cell
               epitope prediction schemes. Beyond improving the understanding
               of immunity, characterization of the functional role of
               different parts of the Ab molecule may help in Ab engineering,

                   formulate protein design as a structure-conditioned sequence

              of the antibody variable heavy chain (CDRH3) often dominates
              antigen-binding specificity. Hence, it is a priority to design
              optimal antigen-specific CDRH3 to develop therapeutic antibodies.
              The combinatorial structure of CDRH3 sequences makes it
              impossible to query binding-affinity oracles exhaustively.
              Moreover, antibodies are expected to have high target specificity
              and developability. Here, we present AntBO, a combinatorial
              Bayesian optimization framework utilizing a CDRH3 trust region
              for an in silico design of antibodies with favorable
              developability scores. The in silico experiments on 159 antigens
              demonstrate that AntBO is a step toward practically viable in
              vitro antibody design. In under 200 calls to the oracle, AntBO
              suggests antibodies outperforming the best binding sequence from
              6.9 million experimentally obtained CDRH3s. Additionally, AntBO
              finds very-high-affinity CDRH3 in only 38 protein designs while
              requiring no domain knowledge.",

               the amount of high-quality experimental structural data
               available in the Protein Data Bank has motivated numerous
               studies to tackle the grand challenge of predicting protein
               structures. In 2020 AlphaFold2 revolutionized the field using a
               combination of artificial intelligence and the evolutionary
               information contained in multiple sequence alignments.
               Antibodies are one of the most important classes of
               biotherapeutic proteins. Accurate structure models are a
               prerequisite to advance biophysical property predictions and
               consequently antibody design. Specialized tools used to predict
               antibody structures based on different principles have profited
               from current advances in protein structure prediction based on
               artificial intelligence. Here, we emphasize the importance of
               reliable protein structure models and highlight the enormous
               advances in the field, but we also aim to increase awareness
               that protein structure models, and in particular antibody
               models, may suffer from structural inaccuracies, namely
               incorrect cis-amide bonds, wrong stereochemistry or clashes. We
               show that these inaccuracies affect biophysical property
               predictions such as surface hydrophobicity. Thus, we stress the

  abstract = "The history of deep learning is unusual in science. The
              perseverance of a small cabal of scientists, working over
              twenty-five years in a seemingly unpromising area, has
              revolution- ized a field and dramatically impacted society.
              Usually, when researchers investigate an esoteric and apparently
              impractical corner of science or engineering, it remains just
              that --- esoteric and impractical. However, this was a notable
              exception. Despite widespread skepticism, the systematic efforts
              of Yoshua Bengio, Geoff Hinton, Yann LeCun, and others eventually
              paid off. The title of this book is ``Understanding Deep
              Learning'' to distinguish it from vol- umes that cover coding and
              other practical aspects. This text is primarily about the ideas
              that underlie deep learning. The first part of the book
              introduces deep learning models and discusses how to train them,
              measure their performance, and improve this performance. The next
              part considers architectures that are specialized to images,
              text, and graph data. These chapters require only introductory
              linear algebra, calculus, and probability and should be
              accessible to any second-year undergraduate in a quantitative
              discipline. Subsequent parts of the book tackle generative models
              and reinforcement learning. These chapters require more knowledge
              of probability and calculus and target more advanced students.
              The title is also partly a joke --- no-one really understands
              deep learning at the time of writing. Modern deep networks learn
              piecewise linear functions with more regions than there are atoms
              in the universe and can be trained with fewer data examples than
              model parameters. It is neither obvious that we should be able to
              fit these functions reliably nor that they should generalize well
              to new data. The final chapter addresses these and other aspects
              that are not yet fully understood. Your time is precious, and I
              have striven to curate and present the material so you can
              understand it as eﬀiciently as possible. The main body of each
              chapter comprises a succinct description of only the most
              essential ideas, together with accompanying illustrations. The
              appendices review all mathematical prerequisites, and there
              should be no need to refer to external material. For readers who
              wish to delve deeper, each chapter has associated problems,
              Python notebooks, and notes that summarize the area's history and
              the latest research. Writing a book is a lonely, grinding,
              multiple-year process and is only worthwhile if the volume is
              widely adopted. If you enjoy reading this or have suggestions for
              improving it, please contact me via the accompanying website. I
              would love to hear your thoughts, which will inform and motivate

                   residues (paratope) closely interact with antigen residues
                   (epitope). Thus, predicting 3D paratope-epitope complex
                   (docking) is the key to finding the best paratope. In this
                   paper, we propose a new model called Hierarchical
                   Equivariant Refinement Network (HERN) for paratope docking
                   and design. During docking, HERN employs a hierarchical

                   them to refine a binding complex in an iterative,

                   the next residue choice. Our results show that HERN
